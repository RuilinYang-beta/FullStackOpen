# About

This repo contains my solutions to the [Full Stack Open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) from University of Helsinki.

# Useful commands

Create and run the demo app with Vite.

```
# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest part1 --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest part1 -- --template react

cd part1
npm install
npm run dev
```
